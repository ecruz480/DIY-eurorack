# Dual "Vintage" VCA
![signal-2024-03-21-084111_002](https://github.com/ecruz480/eurorack-modules/assets/6435014/6f4f284b-3c28-43a9-8146-0afb96839e5f)
This is a VCA designed by Tom Wiltshire of [Electric Druid](https://electricdruid.net/design-a-eurorack-vintage-vca-with-the-lm13700/) and is created using the hearty LM13700 OTA amplifiers. He describes the profile as a "vintage sound", which adds some nice texture when driving the amplifiers at higher gains. Or, it's a good excuse to build a dirt-cheap module and write it off as "vintage", whatever works for you.

Changes made to the original design include doubling it for a 2-in-1 module, as well as cloning the first signal if nothing is connected into the right-most input.

### Features
- Simple design allows for low BOM cost while optimizing space with a 2-in-1 design.
- Control over the amplifier gain including CV control.
- Includes an envelope input to control VCA depth.
- It's    v  i  n  t  a  g  e.
