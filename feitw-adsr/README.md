# ADSR - _Fastest Envelope in the West_
![adsr_feitw_faceplate](https://github.com/ecruz480/eurorack/assets/6435014/e026ff12-774f-4833-904e-624c844dc4ee)
A well known ADSR module based on Ren√© Schmitz's [Fastest Envelope in the West](https://www.schmitzbits.de/adsr.html), which utilizes the 555 timer IC to create the envelopes. It is an easy, simple, lightweight ADSR build requiring few parts and is relatively straighforward to build. Some of the modifications found in my module design are based on [MeeBilt's version](https://github.com/tkilla64/eurorack/tree/main/feitw) of the ADSR (like the envelope-tracking LED).

### Features
- 4 controls to set the length of each ADSR parameter: attack, decay, sustain, release.
- Red LED provides visual feedback of envelope amplitude.
- Bare-bones interface, simple input/output which can receive audio and CV.

### Dimensions
Height: 3U  
Width: 4HP  
Depth: 23.81mm
