# Passive Multiplier
![p-mult-faceplate](https://github.com/ecruz480/eurorack/assets/6435014/9893ef27-202f-466f-abbb-88d77d61d34e)
As simple as it gets. A passive multiplier module (requires no power) that duplicates the inputs 1 and 2 with three distinct copies of the respective input signal. When no signal is inserted into the 2nd jack, the first signal is duplicated across all jacks (not just the first set). A handy utility module that knows no bounds!

### Features
- 2 inputs jacks with 3 distinct outputs.
- If there is no input signal present on the 2nd jack, the 1st signal is duplicated 7 times.
- Passive module, so it requires no power.
