![signal-2024-01-04-101120_002](https://github.com/ecruz480/eurorack/assets/6435014/cb5ad7e7-4ead-4e70-9e43-31cfeda068a7)
This is a filter designed by [Kassutronics](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2019/07/ks-20-filter.html) and is modeled after the famous MS-20 filter with some minor modifications. The 'Blend' knob allows for a smooth tranistion between the two filter stages (as Kassu puts it, "Using two KS-20 modules in series the original MS-20 configuration can be created.").

### Features
- Modeled after a signle filter stage of the famous MS-20 filter. Can blend between the two stages of the filter.
- The 'Peak' control allows for a non-linear resonance path through the use of LEDs. The nonlinear resonance makes the sound of the filter strongly depend on the amplitude of the incoming signal.
- The 'Drive' knob allows for control of the incloming signal amplitude and creates even more depth to the module's core functions.
- Includes inputs for V/Oct and CV.
