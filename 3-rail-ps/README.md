# 3-rail DC power supply
![Final design](https://github.com/ecruz480/DIY-eurorack/assets/6435014/6a194ea7-3997-44ee-8591-bb117d99fe13)
This is a triple rail DC power supply for a modular synthisizer. This design is a modification of benguru's [Eurorack Synthisizer Power Supply](https://www.instructables.com/Eurorack-Synthesizer-Power-Supply/) design. Modifications were made to adjust the output capacitor's and inductor's values to match an operating condition of 12V at 1-1.5A for maximum efficiency.

### Features
- 12V input
- +12V, -12V, and +5V regulated outputs.
- 3 seperate outputs with identical signals for greater use-case flexibility (more modules, bigger case, and so forth...).
- Status LEDs for each power rail to indicate functionality.

### Dimensions
Length: 90.93mm  
Width: 112.78mm  
Height with components: 33.35mm
