![3340-faceplate](https://github.com/ecruz480/eurorack/assets/6435014/78eda35f-a68a-4128-bbea-dd8af087ae8a)
This is a VCO based on the analog AS3340 oscillator IC. This design is a modification of Eddy Bergman's [Digisound 80 VCO](https://www.eddybergman.com/2020/01/synthesizer-build-part-18-really-good.html) design with the adjustment's needed for it to run on 12V instead of 15V.

### Features
- 4 inputs for CV, FM, Sync (positive and negative), and 1V/Oct.
- 3 waveform outputs: Square-wave with PW<, triangle-wave, and reverse sawtooth-wave.
- Control knobs for frequency tuning, fine tuning, PWM, FM control, and CV control.
- Switch included to change between positive and negative sync.

### Dimensions
Height: 3U  
Width: 7HP  
Depth: 25.4 mm
