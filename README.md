# DIY eurorack synth modules  

This repository is focused on sharing my journey of DIY modular synthesis, as well as refining my mixed-signal circuit design skills, from initial concept to final production. As I near the limit my 84hp rack, my goal is to create custom modules that demonstrate quality circuit design principles and advanced layout techniques. I'm beginning with the creation of simpler, user-friendly modules that utilize readily available components. These modules are intended to cater to a broad audience interested in DIY electronics projects. I'm also passionate about highlighting fellow module creators who generously share their work for others to learn from. My overall hope is that you gain some insight and inspiration into the world of engineering and music!

**3-rail-ps**  
Triple rail switching DC power supply. It takes 12VDC as an input and outputs a regulated 12V, -12V, and 5V lines.  

**3340-vco**  
Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) based on the AS3340 IC.  

**5-ch-mixer**  
5 channel mixer that sums all inputs to a single mono output jack. Can be used for audio and CV.  

**feitw-adsr**  
ADSR module based on the iconic 555 timer IC.

**ks-20-filter**  
A VCF module based on the famous MS-20 filter with some minor tweaks.

**passive-mult**  
A simple passive multiplier with 2 inputs and 6 total outputs (3 per each input). When the 2nd input signal is removed, the 1st signal is duplicated 7 distinct times.

**simple-lfo**  
Compact LFO module with saw/square-wave outputs. Selectable range control thats sweeps across frequencies from 0.0025Hz to 250Hz.
