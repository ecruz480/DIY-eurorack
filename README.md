# DIY eurorack modules

This is a repository for my DIY synth modules in eurorack format.

Everything I post on here is either an original design, or taken from another modular creator that shares their designs openly. I try to bring together as many different modular creators together in my DIY system.  

**3340-vco**  
Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) based on the AS3340.  

**simple-lfo**  
Compact LFO module with saw/square-wave outputs. Frequency reange peaks at human-hearing levels.  

**5-ch-mixer**  
5 channel mixer that sums all inputs to a single mono output jack.  

**3-rail-ps**  
Triple rail power supply for modular systems. It takes 12V as an input and outputs a regulated 12V, -12V, and 5V lines.
