# DIY eurorack modules  

Everything I post here is either an original design, or a design based on another modular creator's design who shares their work openly. I try to bring together as many different modular creators in my DIY system to illustrate the vast types of designs people have created for the enjoyment of modular synthesis! I hope you find an inspiring design here to try and build yourself. All relevant modular designers are credited in each README if relevant.     

**3-rail-ps**  
Triple rail switching DC power supply. It takes 12VDC as an input and outputs a regulated 12V, -12V, and 5V lines.  

**3340-vco**  
Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) based on the AS3340 IC.  

**5-ch-mixer**  
5 channel mixer that sums all inputs to a single mono output jack. Can be used for audio and CV.  

**simple-lfo**  
Compact LFO module with saw/square-wave outputs. Selectable range control thats sweeps across frequencies from 0.0025Hz to 250Hz.
