# DIY eurorack modules

This is a repository for my DIY synth modules in eurorack format.

Everything I post on here is either an original design, or taken from another modular creator that shares their designs openly. I try to bring together as many different modular creators together in my DIY system.  

**3340_vco**  
Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) based on the AS3340.

**3_rail_ps**  
Triple rail power supply for modular systems. It takes 12V as an input and outputs a regulated 12V, -12V, and 5V lines.
